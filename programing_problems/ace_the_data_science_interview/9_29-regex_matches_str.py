Hard Problems
9.29. Two Sigma: Given an input string and a regex, write a function that checks whether  the regex
matches the input string.  The input string is composed of the lowercase letters a-z. The regular
expression contains lowercase a-z, '?' or '*', where the '?' matches any one character, and the '*'
matches any arbitrary number of characters (empty as well). For example, if the input string
is "abcdba" and the regex is "a*c?*", return true. However, if the regex was instead "b*c?*"
return false.
